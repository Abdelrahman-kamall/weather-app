# weather-app
my second node js web application
# main goal
get started with APIs and express to start producing the app online
# about the app
mainly the app enables the user to enter the name of a specific place and show info about the forecast for this place
we first perform geocoding on the mapbox api to get the latitude and longitude of this place (the most relevant one with the same name) then add these numbers to the request of the darksky the response back with the total forecast of this place so we choose what we need of it.
# objectives and things learnt
first dealing with different APIs like darksky and mapbox , learn how to deal with the API via the documentation ,how to make different requests with different options , how to interpret the response object and know what each property means.
second learning about call backs in node (asynch or synch) .
also dealing with the request npm module instead of making the basic low level HTTP/s request.
